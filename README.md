# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game

Created a Tic Tac Toe game, using a string of lines and spaces to create the gameboard. 

Each playable space on the gamebaord was then assigned to an int.

The user can choose a number between 1-9 where they can place a marker.

A random generator is then used for the computers turn.

Logic is handled to check if the number chosen has already been played.

The result logic is calculated to check if there are 3 markers line up to declare the winner.
